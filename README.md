## Schedule Builder

## Project Motivation
As college students, we are constantly busy with attending class, studying, and attending office hours; it is difficult for us to coordinate activities with friends during free
time. Planning to meet with others can become cumbersome when you factor in everyone's limited and staggered free time. Whether the event is a quick lunch date or time consuming
like visiting a museum together, the only way to guarantee hanging out with others is to plan for it ahead of time. That's where our project comes in. Our version of a schedule
builder allows multiple people to input their schedules for the week and collectively determine when they have free time in common.

## Project Description
Our schedule builder enables a user to enter events for many people into the user-friendly user interface. The application prompts the user for the person's name, the week of the
month, the day of the week, the event title, the event start time, and the event end time. Once the user is done submitting all of the events, they will click the compare button.
The compare button is what runs our algorithm and determines the availabilities across all of the schedules, where it is then displayed back to the user.

To create our project, we used two different programs to best implement our ideas. First we made multiple java classes to hold attributes for the event, the day of the week,
and the schedule, These classes not only hold the attributes, but they also hold the all of the logic for inputting events, and comparing schedules. We also used WindowBuilder
create Java GUI application to allow the user to interact with our program.

Some of the challenges you faced and features you hope to implement in the future.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Running Our Project
To run our project you will only need access to src, where all of the class files are stored, including the "ScheduleBuilderGUI.java". Once downloaded, the user will compile
ScheduleBuilder.java and run it through the command line, and they can use the program freely from there.

## Using the project


## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
